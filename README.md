## Updates

- [x] created pro tour results list with four basic options

  - choose men or women
  - chose theme
  - choose how many: all, top 5, the ones poositioned to make the half-year cut, the ones who won't make the cut
  - rank event: rank event number one shows the ranking before the first event, there will be a new (reshuffled rankings) option for each completed event

- [x] created menu modal with content enabling changing of these options
- [x] created options menu, an alternative to the modal approach
  - use env var to toggle

### set env var - tells app to show modal versus menu of options

committed .env file
set REACT_APP_SHOW_MENU false to archive the menu option for now

### run app
